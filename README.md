- Hi, I’m Leon @Grichmann!
- I’m interested in videogames and videogame accessories.
- I’m currently learning how to work with others and actually do something useful with my fledgeling coding skills.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any small game project.
- I know C# and Unity best, but how hard can learning a new language or engine be?
- I'm also a little familiar with Java, Python, and C++.
